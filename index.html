    <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize"> i had visited in december 2018</h5>
    <p class="text-muted"> Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of juhu. Blink and you will miss the enterance to the cafe. So be alert to see the black signboard that says "Prithvi Cafe" on the highway. The restaurant has reasonable good prices with a reasonable good menu. The food is good, the servings are quite large and sometimes dishes can be shared by 2.
      Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebreties on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid dissapointments. On other days, the crowd is pretty happening.
      Hosts the famous"Prithvi theatre fest", which you must attent if possible.

      <p>I watched it and loved it. 90% of the time u have to have some back-ground knowledge before watching marvel movies by watching the movies in order from first to last. However, this movie was enjoyed much by me and my family members and i definately recommend it to others who are thinking of watching it. (spoiler alert) The dismemberment of the head in the beggining of the movie was quite realistic and impressive. It shows how the avengers have to get together once and for all to reverse thanos's actions and restore peace to the universe. This movie however is legthy (3 hours) but its all worthwhile. It is an roller coaster of emotions and THIS MOVIE REALLY DOES DESERVE ITS 5 STAR REVIEW FROM ME!</p>

      <p>Out of all the movies that had ever come out of Disney, "The Lion King" is what I consider to be their greatest achievement of all time. Right as the opening sequence commenced with the "Circle of Life", my heart was so pumped, down to the point where I felt like a kid again every time I saw it. The story was epic on giving an insight of the steps in becoming the next-in-line, the challenges on losing someone dear to them and overcoming their fears, and fighting for what's rightfully theirs. Not only that, but its breathtaking animation really grabs the viewers' experience by showcasing the vast landscapes surrounding Pride Rock as well as all the natural wildlife that settles within. When it comes to the characters, they all had their unique chemistry towards each other and it was really touching to have a father-son relationship spreading throughout most of the movie, which would come in handy for the main character to discover who he really is. While all of this definitely had their moments, the main reason why I consider this as the absolute best to come from Disney would have to be its powerful and emotional score.</p>
